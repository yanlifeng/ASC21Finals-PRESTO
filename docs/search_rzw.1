.SH DESCRIPTION
This program searches an FFT found in the input file for pulsars using
a Fourier domain acceleration search (i.e. Ransom and Eikenberry,
2000, in prep.).  The search uses a spacing of 0.5 frequency bins in
the fourier frequency (r) direction and 2 'bins' in the fdot (z)
direction.

The 'zapfile', if present, contains a list of center frequencies (Hz)
and widths (Hz), which the search routine should ignore (usually these
are known noise sources in the data).  Lines beginning with '#' are
ignored.  The example file would be:

# Freq(Hz) Freq-width(Hz)
.br
60.0 0.02
.br
120.0 0.01
.br

The routine outputs formatted statistics for the 'ncand' best
candidates found in the search region.  The routine currently cannot
search the 'w' dimension.  This may be fixed shortly.
