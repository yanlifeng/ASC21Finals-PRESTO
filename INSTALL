Basic steps to install:

(Note:  For Mac users, please see the bottom of the document!)

1.  Install FFTW3.X  You need to compile FFTW for _single_
  precision (see the config flags I recommend below).

  For all architectures I recommend the following configuration:
  ./configure --enable-shared --enable-single

  Use the --prefix=SOME_PATH option to install the library and
  its related files to SOME_PATH.  (If you have admin access to 
  your machine, --prefix=/usr/local is the default for FFTW and
  is a safe bet).

  If you are on a modern Intel processor and have a recent version
  of GCC, you can get much improved performance by adding:
  --enable-sse --enable-sse2 --enable-avx --enable-avx2 --enable-fma

  Ubuntu has good FFTW packages: libfftw3-bin and libfftw3-dev

  Note that if you install to a non-default directory, you will likely
  need to edit setup.py for the python install to add the locations of
  the include files (in the "include_dirs" variable) as well as the
  path to the libraries (in "presto_library_dirs").

2.  Install PGPLOT.  http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
  You need the X-windows and postscript drivers at a minimum.
  Note that on 64-bit systems, compiling and linking PGPLOT can
  be tricky!

  It is very likely that you will need to have the PGPLOT_DIR
  environment variable specified to allow the programs to link and to
  allow PGPLOT to find its important files.

  Ubuntu has a good PGPLOT package: pgplot5
  And on Ubuntu, I have PGPLOT_DIR=/usr/lib/pgplot5

  If you install to a non-standard location, see the note in #1
  about editing the setup.py file for the python install!

3.  Install TEMPO.  Make sure to set the TEMPO environment variable.
  http://tempo.sourceforge.net/

4.  Install GLIB (v2.X). 
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/ On Linux machines this 
  is almost certainly already on your system (check in /usr/lib 
  and /usr/include/glib*).  Although you may need to install a 
  glib development package in order to have the required include 
  files...

  On Ubuntu, the package you need is: libglib2.0-dev

5.  Install CFITSIO.
  http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
  This is a very easy install and is now needed since PSRFITS
  is now being written by several pulsar instruments (Nice!
  a pulsar data standard that external tools can actually
  view!  How about that!)

  Ubuntu has CFITSIO packages: libcfitsio3 and libcfitsio3-dev

  If you install to a non-standard location, see the note in #1
  about editing the setup.py file for the python install!

6.  Define the PRESTO environment variable to the top level
  directory of the PRESTO distribution (i.e. this directory).

7.  cd to $PRESTO/src.  Check and modify the Makefile for your
  machine of choice.  Ensure that the library and include file
  directories are correct for FFTW, PGPLOT, GLIB, CFITSIO, 
  and TEMPO.

8.  If you are using FFTW, do a 'make makewisdom'.  This gets
  FFTW acquainted with your system.  It is best if you are the
  only user on the machine when you run this, as it is very
  computation intensive and may take a while.

9.  Just for safety's sake, do a "make prep".  That will make sure
  that make does not try to run Clig to re-generate all of the
  command line interface files.

10.  Do a 'make'.  This will make all of the executables.  If you
  want mpiprepsubband (for parallel de-dispersion on clusters) 
  you will need to do a 'make mpi' as well.

11.  The required libraries and miscellaneous files will be
  located in $PRESTO/lib.  The executables will be in $PRESTO/bin.
  You may copy or move the executables wherever you like, but 
  the library files should stay put.  (That's why you define the 
  PRESTO variable -- so the routines can find them).

  Given the new use of "-Wl,-rpath,$(PRESTO)/lib" during linking
  (thanks to Mike Keith for the tip!), you no longer need
  $PRESTO/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
  However, you do still need $PRESTO/bin in your PATH, or else
  you can copy/link all of the files that are in $PRESTO/bin to
  somewhere that *is* in your path.

12.  If you want to save some disk space, do a 'make clean' in
  the 'src' directory.  This will leave the libraries and
  binaries in their respective directories but will get rid of
  all the extra stuff in the 'src' directory.

13.  If you want to use all the python routines (which if you are
  doing anything but the most rudimentary analyses you will want 
  to), you need Python >= version 2.7 or >= 3.6, and Numpy/Scipy
  http://www.numpy.org  and  http://www.scipy.org
  In general, the following should work:
     "cd $PRESTO ; pip install ."
  if you are using a virtual environment or have permissions for
  installing normal Python packages.  If not, you may need to
  install as an administrator or with the "--user" flag.  With
  this new and better Python installation you do *not* need
  to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable anymore and so you
  should ensure that it doesn't contain $PRESTO/lib/python as in
  the past.

  If you want to test some of the Python code (especially the
  trickiest bits to get compiled and installed), you can run:
     "python tests/test_presto_python.py"
  and you should get a bunch of tests and a bunch of "success"es.

14.  Go find pulsars!

TROUBLE SHOOTING
----------------
Couple quick trouble-shooting tips if you are having problems
compiling and running:

1.  Environment variables!
  -- Is PRESTO set to the top-level PRESTO source directory?
  -- Is TEMPO set to the top-level TEMPO source directory?
  -- Is PGPLOT_DIR set to the location of the PGPLOT utility files?
     (Note: On Ubuntu, that should be /usr/lib/pgplot5)
  -- Is $PRESTO/bin in your PATH? (It should be!)
  -- Is $PRESTO/lib/python in your PYTHONPATH? (It shouldn't be now!)

2.  Have you have installed the relevant -dev packages for glib2, FFTW
  and CFITSIO if you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution?
  Here are the required packages:
    gfortran
    pgplot5
	libcfitsio-dev
	libfftw3-dev
	libpng-dev
    libx11-dev
	libglib2.0-dev

3.  If you are having trouble with PRESTO creating polycos, you can
   use prepfold with the "-debug" option when folding using "-timing".
   That will show you the TEMPO call and keep all of the (usually)
   temporary output files.

4.  If you are using a Mac, Paul Ray has been running PRESTO a lot and
  knows several tricks to get it working:

   PRESTO should build almost "out of the box" on a Mac. I have had
   success using MacPorts to install the necessary dependencies. You
   will need MacPorts packages: pgplot, cfitsio, glib2, fftw-3,
   fftw-3-single, and gcc5 You can probably use a more recent gcc
   instead, if you prefer (e.g. gcc8).  It just needs to provide
   gfortran.

   TEMPO should build easily with gfortran. I did not make any changes
   to the distro.

   Also you need to delete the line #include "error.h" from
   src/backend_common.c

   For python, you will need to install numpy, scipy, etc. using
   MacPorts or pip, as you prefer.

   Finally, in $PRESTO/setup.py you might need to add
   "/opt/local/include" to the include_dirs.

   Then, just follow the PRESTO installation instructions (cd src;
   make; make makewisdom; cd .. ; pip install .)
