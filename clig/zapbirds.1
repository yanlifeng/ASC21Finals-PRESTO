.br
1 String value
.IP -in
A file containing a list of freqs (Hz) and the # of harmonics to zap,
.br
1 String value
.IP -out
A file to write that will contain the freqs and widths (Hz) zapped,

.\" cligPart DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
