Default: `1000'
.IP -r
The Fourier frequency to fold (bins),
.br
1 Double value between 1.0 and 2000000000.0.
.IP -p
The period to fold (s),
.br

.br
1 Double value.
.IP -fftnorm
Use local powers from '.fft' file to get 'norm'.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
