.\" cligPart SYNOPSIS end

.\" cligPart OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -ncpus
Number of processors to use with OpenMP,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.br
Default: `1'
.IP -o
Root of the output file names,
.br
1 String value
.IP -filterbank
Raw data in SIGPROC filterbank format.
.IP -psrfits
Raw data in PSRFITS format.
.IP -noweights
Do not apply PSRFITS weights.
.IP -noscales
Do not apply PSRFITS scales.
.IP -nooffsets
Do not apply PSRFITS offsets.
.IP -window
Window correlator lags with a Hamming window before FFTing.
.IP -if
A specific IF to use if available (summed IFs is the default),
.br
1 Int value between 0 and 1.
.IP -clip
Time-domain sigma to use for clipping (0.0 = no clipping, 6.0 = default,
.br
1 Float value between 0 and 1000.0.
.br
Default: `6.0'
.IP -noclip
Do not clip the data.  (The default is to _always_ clip!).
.IP -invert
For rawdata, flip (or invert) the band.
.IP -zerodm
Subtract the mean of all channels from each sample (i.e. remove zero DM).
.IP -nobary
Do not barycenter the data.
.IP -shorts
Use short ints for the output data instead of floats.
.IP -numout
Output this many values.  If there are not enough values in the original data file, will pad the output file with the average value,
.br
1 Long value between 1 and oo.
.IP -downsamp
The number of neighboring bins to co-add,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 128.
.br
Default: `1'
.IP -offset
Number of spectra to offset into as starting data point,
.br
1 Long value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -start
Starting point of the processing as a fraction of the full obs,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and 1.0.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -dm
The dispersion measure to de-disperse (cm^-3 pc),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -mask
File containing masking information to use,
.br
1 String value
.IP -ignorechan
Comma separated string (no spaces!) of channels to ignore (or file containing such string).  Ranges are specified by min:max[:step],
.br
1 String value
.IP infile
Input data file name.  If the data is not in a known raw format, it should be a single channel of single-precision floating point data.  In this case a '.inf' file with the same root filename must also exist (Note that this means that the input data file must have a suffix that starts with a period).

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
